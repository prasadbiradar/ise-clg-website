 The Department motivates staff towards research other than teaching. Faculties of ISE are engaged in paper publication and around 35 publications have appeared in various national and international journals and conferences of IEEE, ACM, Springers, Elsevier etc.Research center of ISE has 2 guides namely Dr. J.Prakash and Dr.R.Nagaraja and around 8 students are working as research scholars under various themes like Digital Image processing, Digital Image processing and applications, pervasive middleware, Cloud computing, Routing In social networks etc.Students are also encouraged for paper publications.</p>
